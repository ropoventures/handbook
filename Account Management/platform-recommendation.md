In order to reap the full rewards of our services, our ideal clients are turning over at least $25,000 in revenue every month. Although we can adapt our processess and approach to work to fit most budgets, we advise on the caveats of such concessions and cannot take responsibility for risks that may have otherwise been avoided had we not compromised on our processes. 

We use the following criteria as GUIDELINES when it comes to recommending what platform to build on; emphasis on the word guidelines, as some clients require customizations or integrations that would make more sense on Magento compared to Shopify.

## Shopify
- Gross revenue is less than $250,000 per year
- Unique visitors per month is less than 1,000
- Orders per month is less than 100

## Magento Community Edition:
- Gross revenue is less than $1,000,000 per year
- Unique visitos per month is less than 50,000
- Orders per month is more than 100 
- Store only sells in one country / currency

## Magento Enterprise Edition:
- Gross revenue is more than $1,000,000 per year
- Unique visitors per month is more than 50,000
- Orders per month is more than 500

- PCIe is essential (when not using payment gateways)
- Store sells worldwide using multiple currencies and languages

Clients that are just starting their e-commerce channels are recommended to go with Shopify. Typically, being more restricted and not having to worry about customisability and platform support enables these businesess to focus on areas that are going to make a bigger difference on revenue during this period. 

We are not Magento partners so there is no bias for us to push for the exponentially more expensive Enterprise edition when there is no tangible benefit on doing so.

For clients that are interested in Magento Enterpise, we normally go through the list of Enterprise features together and if a significant number of these features are absolutely required by the client, it may be more cost effective to pay for an Enterprise edition versus deploying comparable extensions that offer the same benefits as the said features. For large scale enterprises, the warranty and support that Magento Enterprise provides may be valuable enough to justify the license fee which can range from $22,000 to $125,000 per year depending on the gross sales revenue.
