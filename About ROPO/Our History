##Our History
ROPO was incorporated in 2016, but was originally founded in 2012 under a different name by one of the original Zalora Philippines Co-founders and Managing Director, Brian Cu. The team is mostly comprised of the pioneer employees of Zalora Philippines, giving it a distinct advantage when it comes to efficient operations and processes of the local E-commerce scene.

The departure from Zalora brought about in response the need of merchants who experienced the benefits of E-commerce and wanted their own site and operations, but 
lacked the knowledge, experience or resource required to pull it off on their own. As a 
response to the increasing demand of local merchants, a small group of people came up with a solution; one agency who can offer everything you’ll need to run your entire e-commerce channel, whether from scratch or existing, a mom-and-pop or multinational.

Shortly after, ROPO found itself in the service of many of the largest retail leaders in the country. Catering to retail merchants from apparel, shoes, accessories, and even groceries. A big departure from the original intent of helping SMEs, but a welcome one at the same time.

In 2016, we partnered with the largest telecom company in the country, Globe, as their official service integrator for Shopify, bringing ROPO back full circle to our original intent of being service to SMEs across the country.

Today, we continue to help businesses where they need it most, whether it’s acting as their entire e-commerce department, or stepping in to help in a select part of their online channel operations.
