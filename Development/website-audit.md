Some clients already have an existing platform when they get in touch with us. For these, our first priority is to conduct a site audit in order to familiarise ourselves with their current implementation in order to provide effective support as soon as we become responsible for it.

In order to do this, we review the code base against the following set of categories and provide feedback in the form of traffic light ratings (red, yellow, green) to give the client advise on its risk and impact (if any):

## Maintainability 
are regression issues likely to occur when proeeding to make changes to the site? 
Are there any tests that validate business logic?

## Extendability
has the code been written in such a way to anticpate changing requirements?

## Performance
Are there issues found while reviewing the frontend or backend code that will reduce the performance of the site?

## Scalability
Are there issues found that will reduce the ability of the site to handle a large number of visitors (typically due to bottlenecks)

## Security
We are not performing a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT), but we may bring up issues if we find them.
